                <p> Cabbage is a common vegetable consumed in almost every household, but there are many misconceptions
                    and myths associated with this cruciferous vegetable. As per the common myth, it is believed that
                    eating raw cabbage can lead to the development of tapeworm, which can alter the nervous system and
                    infect the brain with Neurocysticercosis.</p><br>

                <p>
                    However, experts suggest that Neurocysticercosis causing tapeworms usually enter the body and brain
                    due to improper and unhygienic conditions like open defecation in the farms and consumption of
                    uninspected pork, which may turn fatal in case of ignorance.

                <p>
                    Neurocysticercosis is basically a parasitic infection of the central nervous system that enters the
                    body due to the pork tapeworm Taenia solium.This tapeworm may infect humans in case of eating
                    undercooked food and observing poor hygiene practices.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    According to experts, open defecation in farms is one of the main reasons that can lead to tapeworms
                    and the easiest way to deal with this is by cleaning the veggies and leafy greens thoroughly and
                    cooking them properly. It can be concluded that eating cabbage does not lead to breeding of
                    tapeworms in the brain and body. However, this may happen with any vegetable cultivated under
                    unhygienic conditions, thus it is essential to thoroughly clean the veggies and then consume them.
