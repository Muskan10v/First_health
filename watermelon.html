                    Sweet and juicy watermelon is a symbol of summer. At a glance, you might assume it’s mostly sugar
                    and water. But once you dig in and discover its vast array of nutrients, you’ll be surprised how
                    many potential health benefits it has.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Watermelon rinds have less sugar and more fiber than their flesh and also contain citrulline.
                    Watermelon seeds – dried or raw – rich in magnesium and folate, which help your body work well and
                    avoid disease.
                </p><br>

                <p>Watermelon can be a great option if you are trying to maintain or achieve a healthy weight, and
                    resist the temptation of higher calorie sweet snacks. Because it contains so much water, watermelon
                    has few calories and can make you feel full for longer.

                <p>
                    Watermelon has more lycopene than any other fruit or vegetable – including tomatoes. It’s also the
                    highest source of the amino acid citrulline, which produces a molecule called nitric oxide that
                    helps relax blood vessels.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    Watermelon’s generous dose of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supports your immune system, which fights
                    germs and infection.

                    Vitamin C in watermelon helps your body produce collagen, which supports your immune system, the
                    health of your cells and your ability to heal from injuries. Collagen gives strength and elasticity
                    to your skin and helps replace dead skin cells. This means eating watermelon could improve your skin
                    and show age- related effects.
