                    Soya Chunks are textured vegetable protein (TVP) or textured soy protein (TSP). Extraction of beans gives soyabean oil.
                    The by -product that is left behind is called soy flour. Incidentally, this flour led to the formation of soya chunks.

                <p>
                Since all the oil is removed,the flour is defeated. So,soya chunks are ideally fat- free. The protein in soya chunks is
                on par with real meat. Moreover,they are low in fat and are pocket friendly. Hence, they get their name as ‘Vegetarian’s
                meat’.

                <p>This unique plant based protein is known to reduce body weight and fat mass. The fibre content in soya chunks keeps
                hunger at bay. In addition, they can keep you full for long hours. Thus when taken in correct proportion, soya chunks
                can aid in your weight loss journey.

                    Soya proteins are largely beneficial to humans, however consumption over the recommended amount can cause adverse
                    reactions. In a review, it was observed that soy protein may have effects on endocrine glands , toxic effects on kidney
                    and liver, and may have many other effects. Therefore, it is necessary to be very cautious while taking soya chunks in
                    large quantities.
