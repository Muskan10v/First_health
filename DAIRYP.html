                <p class="text-lg font-bold mb-8 leading-relaxed">The regular consumption of dairy products in your
                    daily diet is going to make you fat and gain
                    more weight over time – not lose it. Dairy Products are not fattening, and what’s more is that they
                    can have an opposite effect which
                    has been proven through several studies.
                </p><br>

                <p> The first study , and the one I found most interesting , was published in the International Journal
                    of
                    Obesity , where 14 clinical trials experimented on 883 adults in the age range of 18-85. The ideas
                    behind the research was to see how dairy products affected the participant’s weight , muscles mass,
                    and
                    far. Researchers found that 3-4 servings of dairy products – combined with a low calorie diet –
                    actually
                    contributed to weight loss when compared to those adults who compeltely skipped all forms of dairy
                    produce from their daily diet.</p><br>

                <p>The second study I found on this topic was conducted by Danit R. Shahar,RD,PhD. ITe concluded that
                    calcium and Vitamin D , may contribute to a healthy weight loss regime. ITe studied 322 obese adults
                    in
                    their middle age, and found that those with highest calcium intake had lost the most weight overall.
                    It
                    should also be noted that patients were not instructed to use a specific dict or workout routine
                    during
                    the course of the study.

                    Take cottage cheese example. It’s known to be very low yet contains a lot of protein which will
                    fills
                    you up. This contributes to a better controlled weight loss plan by curbing hunger through the
                    consumption of small amounts . In fact, many of the popular diets use chesse in their meal planning.
                </p>

                <p> Honestly, dairy products has been a popular ingredients in our food since the very beginning of
                    humankind, so claiming that it is responsible for making us for all far now, doesn’t make any
                    sense
                    at all especially when our society is dominated by so much processed and fast food.
