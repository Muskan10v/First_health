                    Dalia is loaded with a range of health benefits. It has long been a part of Indian cuisine for ages.
                    Made with broken wheat, Dalia is easy to digest and is full of nutrition. It is high in fibre and is
                    believed to be one of the best foods for weight loss.

                    Eating a bowl of dalia daily is helpful in losing weight. Dalia is loaded with fibre which will keep
                    you satiated for long and thus help in weight loss. It is also low in calories.
                </p><br>

                <p>Dalia is basically wheat with husk. Naturally, the husk makes this food rich in fibre, which cleanses
                    the intestines and prevents constipation.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Dalia contains complex carbohydrates and is low in glycemic index. This ensures a steady release of
                    glucose in the blood, which helps in managing blood sugar.

                    Due to high fibre content, it helps in maintaining the cholesterol level of the body and is healthy
                    for the heart.

                <p>
                    Dalia has been used traditionally as a weaning food for babies. Not just the fact that it is highly
                    nutritious, but also because it is free from any strong taste and smell and mixes easily with milk
                    and veggies, it is one of the best weaning foods ever.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    Dalia is a natural source of B- vitamin, minerals, fibre and protein and is much healthier than
                    packaged foods as it has no preservatives. You can also make interesting dishes with it and hence it
                    is ideal food for growing children.
