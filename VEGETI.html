                <p class="text-lg font-bold mb-8 leading-relaxed">Vegetarian, or plant based diets, is the most
                    efficient way to lose and maintain a healthy
                    weight. This is because they tend to contain less calories and fat.
                </p><br>

                <p> Also, people who are vegetarian are thinner than those who are not, which means that eating the same
                    foods as they do will make you a leaner person too.

                    There are several studies that show a correlation between a vegetarian diet and weight loss.
                    However,
                    there are no actual guarantee that following a specific vegetarian eating plan makes you lose more
                    weight compared to a regular diet that is balanced with animal produce.

                    A study published in the International Journal of Obesity (IJO), showed that overweight adults who
                    were
                    instructed to follow a vegetarian diet for a period of 18 months, lost about 7.9% – on average – of
                    their total body weight.</p><br>

                <p>At the same time, a second group of adults within the same weight range were instructed to follow a
                    regular diet. The results showed that these participants lost, on average, 0.1% more weight than the
                    group that followed the vegetarian diet.

                    According to Katherine Zeratsky, R.D.,L.D., the key to losing weight is not a simple case of
                    switching
                    to a plant based diet. You can still gain weight by consuming only vegetarian meals if you are not
                    paying attention to the size of your portions, and type of foods you consume.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    She also says that the reasons why many vegetarians tend to be leaner than folks who consume meats,
                    eggs,and dairy products in their regular meals, is because the vegetarian Diets usually contain less
                    saturated fat.
                </p>

                <p> You need to get to know your body, be mindful of how much and how often you consume food, snack in
                    between,and of course the exact types of meals you consume in a typical day, week and month.
