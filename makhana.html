                    Makhana is a type of seed derived from the Euryale Ferox plant. Theyâ€™re also sometimes referred to
                    as fox nuts or lotus Seeds. Makhanas are widely cultivated throughout Asia and often used in
                    traditional forms of medicine to treat various conditions.

                    Makhana is an excellent source of several important nutrients and makes a great addition to a
                    healthy, well rounded diet. It contains a good amount of carbs in each serving and is also rich in
                    several micronutrients, including calcium, magnesium, iron and phosphorus.

                <p>
                    Makhana is rich in various antioxidants, which are compounds that help neutralize harmful free
                    radicals and prevent oxidation stress.

                    Adding makhana seeds to your diet is a great way to boost your intake of protein and fibre- two key
                    nutrients that may benefit weight loss. Protein has been shown to reduce food cravings and help
                    regulate your appetite. Meanwhile, fibre moves slowly through your digestive tract to keep you
                    feeling full during the day.

                <p>
                    One of the most popular ways to prepare makhana involves roasting the seeds and seasoning them with
                    your choice of herbs and spices, such as sea salt, turmeric, chilli powder, or black pepper. It can
                    be roasted and enjoyed as a savory snack or added to desserts.
