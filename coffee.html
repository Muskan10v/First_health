                    Coffee is the go-to morning beverage for many, while others choose not to drink it for a host of
                    reasons. <br> <br>
                    For some, the high amount of caffeine can cause nervousness and agitation, also known as “the
                    jitters.” For others,
                    coffee can cause digestive distress and headaches.
                    <br>
                    Many simply don’t care for the bitter taste or are bored with their usual morning cup of joe.
                </p>
                <p>Here are delicious alternatives to coffee you can try.
                </p><br><br>

                <b>1. Matcha tea</b><br>
                <div class=" lg:hidden lg:max-w-lg lg:w-full md:w-1/2 w-5/6 flex justify-center">
                    <img class="object-cover object-center rounded" alt="hero" src="Image/coffee_metha.jpg">
                </div>
                <p>Matcha is a type of green tea made by steaming, drying and grinding the leaves of the Camellia
                    sinensis plant into a
                    fine powder.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    In contrast to brewable green tea, you consume the whole leaf. For this reason, you’re getting a
                    much more concentrated
                    source of antioxidants — epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), in particular.
                    <br>
                    Many of the proposed benefits of matcha are attributed to EGCG. For example, observational studies
                    suggest regularly
                    green tea consumption may reduce your risk of high blood pressure.

                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Green tea has also been associated with reduced weight and body fat, as well as a lower risk of type
                    2 diabetes.
                    Matcha has a fresh flavor, which some describe as earthy.

                <b>2. Golden milk</b><br>
                
                <div class=" lg:hidden lg:max-w-lg lg:w-full md:w-1/2 w-5/6 flex justify-center">

                </div>
                <p>Golden milk is a rich, caffeine-free substitute for coffee.
                
                    This warm beverage incorporates invigorating spices such as ginger, cinnamon, turmeric and black
                    pepper. Other common
                    additions include cardamom, vanilla and honey.
                </p><br>
                
                <p>
                    Besides giving your drink a beautiful golden color, turmeric may have powerful anti-inflammatory
                    properties due to the
                    potent chemical curcumin.
                    <br>
                    What’s more, black pepper increases your body’s ability to absorb curcumin, as does fat. Therefore,
                    you may want to
                    consider using whole milk versus fat-free for this drink .

                </div>
                <p>Switching up your morning beverage doesn’t have to be complicated. Lemon water is a great way to
                    start your day.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s calorie- and caffeine-free and provides an ample dose of vitamin C.
                    <br><br>
                
                    As an antioxidant, vitamin C plays a role in your immune system and protects your skin from sun
                    damage. It’s essential
                    for creating collagen, a protein that provides the basic structure for your skin, tendons and
                    ligaments.

                <p>
                    Just one glass of lemon water — prepared by adding the juice of half a lemon (1 tablespoon or 15 ml)
                    to 1 cup (237 ml)
                    of cold water — provides 10% of your RDI for vitamin C .
                    <br>
                    You can also add other fruits and herbs for a variety of flavors — cucumbers, mint, watermelon and
                    basil are some
                    popular options.
