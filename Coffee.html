                <p class="text-lg font-bold mb-8 leading-relaxed"> Coffee is the go-to morning beverage for many, while
                    others choose not to drink it for a host of reasons.
                </p><br>

                <p> For some, the high amount of caffeine can cause nervousness and agitation, also known as “the
                    jitters.” For others, coffee can cause digestive distress and headaches.

                    Many simply don’t care for the bitter taste or are bored with their usual morning cup of joe.

                    Here are delicious alternatives to coffee you can try.</p><br>

                <h3><b>1. Matcha Tea</b>
                    <hr>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Matcha is a type of green tea made by steaming, drying and grinding the leaves of the Camellia
                    sinensis plant into a fine powder.

                    In contrast to brewable green tea, you consume the whole leaf. For this reason, you’re getting a
                    much more concentrated source of antioxidants — epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), in particular.

                    Many of the proposed benefits of matcha are attributed to EGCG. For example, observational studies
                    suggest regularly green tea consumption may reduce your risk of high blood pressure.

                    Green tea has also been associated with reduced weight and body fat, as well as a lower risk of type
                    2 diabetes.

                    Matcha has a fresh flavor, which some describe as earthy.
                </p><br>

                <h3><b>2. Golden Milk</b>
                    <hr>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Golden milk is a rich, caffeine-free substitute for coffee.

                    This warm beverage incorporates invigorating spices such as ginger, cinnamon, turmeric and black
                    pepper. Other common additions include cardamom, vanilla and honey.

                    Besides giving your drink a beautiful golden color, turmeric may have powerful anti-inflammatory
                    properties due to the potent chemical curcumin.

                    What’s more, black pepper increases your body’s ability to absorb curcumin, as does fat. Therefore,
                    you may want to consider using whole milk versus fat-free for this drink .
                </p><br>

                <h3><b>3. Lemon Water</b>
                    <hr>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Switching up your morning beverage doesn’t have to be complicated. Lemon water is a great way to
                    start your day.

                    It’s calorie- and caffeine-free and provides an ample dose of vitamin C.

                    As an antioxidant, vitamin C plays a role in your immune system and protects your skin from sun
                    damage. It’s essential for creating collagen, a protein that provides the basic structure for your
                    skin, tendons and ligaments.

                    Just one glass of lemon water — prepared by adding the juice of half a lemon (1 tablespoon or 15 ml)
                    to 1 cup (237 ml) of cold water — provides 10% of your RDI for vitamin C .

                    You can also add other fruits and herbs for a variety of flavors — cucumbers, mint, watermelon and
                    basil are some popular options.
