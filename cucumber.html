                    Cucumbers are also low in calories and contain a good amount of water and soluble fibre, making them

                    Cucumbers are low in calories but high in many important vitamins and minerals. Cucumbers also have
                    a high water content. They’re made up of about 96% water. To maximize their nutrients, cucumbers
                    should be eaten unpeeled. Peeling them reduces the amount of fiber, as well as certain vitamins and
                    minerals.

                    Cucumbers could potentially help you lose weight in a few different ways. This means you can eat
                    plenty of cucumbers without packing on the extra calories that lead to weight gain. Furthermore, the

                    Dehydration is a major risk factor for constipation, as it can alter your water balance and make the
                    passage of stool difficult. Cucumbers are high in water and promote hydration. Staying hydrated can
                    improve stool consistency, prevent constipation, and help maintain regularity.
