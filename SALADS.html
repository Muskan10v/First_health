                <p class="text-lg font-bold mb-8 leading-relaxed">Here are some terrific combinations to start with right away:
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    1)Cucumber, tomato, and red onion.<br>
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    2)Red pepper, scallions, and mushrooms<br>
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    3)Carrots, red cabbage, and cucumber<br>
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    4)Romaine lettuce, red cabbage, and red pepper<br>
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    5)Avocado, white onion, and tomato<br>
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    6)Green pepper, scallion, and tomato<br>
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    If you want to add some great flavor to these 3 ingredient salads, throw on some capers, black
                    olives,
                    oregano, black paper, and sea salt for extra flavor.
                    Adding cheese and croutons to a salad will also add unnecessary calories and ingredients to food.
                </p><br>
                <p> If you dress your salad with a little olive oil, there may even be some additional years in it for
                    you. Italian research on people aged 60 and older has suggested that a diet that includes plenty of
                    olive oil and raw vegetables is linked to reduced mortality.
