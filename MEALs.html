                    Attempting to lose weight by skipping meals is like trying to swim wearing flippers made of
                    lead.This is really a bad idea and whoever recommended it is talking through a whole in their head!

                People who go to fast diets regularly,can,and do,cause themselves severe health problems, especially in
                the long terms.

                </p><br>

                <p> 
                    There are several studies that suggest those who skip Breakfast and eat less than three times per day ,
                    you run the risk of being heavier compared to individuals who eat five or six times daily.
                </p><br>

                <p>The rule of thumb here is to split your meals up so that you eat every three hours or so. Controlling
                    your food intake in this way helps to suppress your appetite and keep your metabolism working. I always
                    have two fruits in my bag when going to work and I eat one three hours before lunch and the other one
                    three after lunch .
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    This is the simple method of eating that really does help you to lose weight more effectively , and
                without depriving your body of the food it needs to function. However, there is drawback in that you
                will need a fair amount of discipline and determination in order to get positive results from this
                approach to controlled eating.
                </p><br>
            
                <p>
                    People who are new to the world of training and nutrition often beleive that skipping meals is a kind of
                necessary punishment for being overweight , and that they deserve to be hungry for letting themselves go
                . It’s the old ‘No pain no gain’ mindset.
                </p><br>
                <p> To summarise this, I want you to avoid anything that can be labelled as a fast, quick,or crash
                    dieting. Although you might lose some pounds , you will gain the weight back really quick the moment
                    you come off the diet.Furthermore, you can cause disruption to the major organs inside your body , and depending on how much
                    the diet interfere with normal functioning , it could take quite some time to recover!
