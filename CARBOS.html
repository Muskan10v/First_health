                <p class="text-lg font-bold mb-8 leading-relaxed"> Carbohydrates (or carbs), are one of the hidden pitfalls when it comes to losing weight, and why?
                    Because they make you gain extra pounds without even being aware of it!
                </p><br>

                <p> With today’s media coverage on living healthier, there have been plenty of myths thrown around warning
                    the public to watch out for this, and stay away from that! One of the most frequent myths is that if you
                    really want to lose weight then you must avoid carbohydrates. People today are auspicious and scared to
                    eat anything that has ‘carbohydrates’ on the label. They have come to believe the item will make them
                    gain weight and therefore spoil all their hard work at losing it.<br><br>
                    Avoiding carbohydrates is a really bad dieting strategy. They are in fact one of the fundamental
                    ingredients used by the body for it to function properly, i.e.,they give it energy, and a
                    well-functioning body is better able to help you lose weight than one that is not.
                    Carbohydrates are typically divided into two different types, known as simple and complex, or sugar and
                    starch.</p><br>

                <p>Simple Carbohydrates (simple sugar)- The refined ones include sugars found in fruits, honey, malt
                    products, milk, and vegetables, but also in less nutritious foods like refined sugars ( the white
                    sugar
                    we buy at the supermarket), and ice creams etc.
                    <br><br>
                    Complex Carbohydrates (starches)- The other type of carbs is the natural unrefined type, known as
                    complex carbohydrates. These include starches which are found in foods such as grain
                    products,i.e.,bread,crackers,pasta,rice,some fruits, and leguminous plants.
                </p><br>
            

                <p> It’s probably fair to say that most refined carbohydrates are jam packed with energy but contain
                    very
                    little nutrition, while the majority of unrefined carbs are the much healthier options, and should
                    be
                    included as a part of your healthier diet.
                    <br><br>
                    When you eat carbohydrates they are broken down into something called glucose. Glucose is a simple
                    sugar
                    and an important source of energy for the body. It really is a crucial nutrient that must enter the
                    cells. You might already know that your cells are responsible for keeping your body functioning
                    properly.
                    <br>
                    A healthy diet should contain at least 50% of unrefined carbohydrates and the rest should come from
                    protein. Don’t forget to include fat as well as Polyunsaturated sources. None of the ingredients are
                    of
                    any use without carbohydrates, because they must exist in order to hold it together, make it strong,
                    and
                    truly functional.
