                Yoga is an ancient spiritual practice from India that uses breath control, physical exercise, and meditative postures.
                The practice of yoga uses “asanas” or various physical poses to achieve a divine connection with the universe. In fact,
                the word yoga means “union” in Sanskrit. Some people refer to yoga as meditation, where you calm your mind and create
                awareness through doing the poses.

                    Meditation or “dhyana” is also part of yoga. Like the physical practice of yoga, dhyana also forms a profound connection
                    with the universe by doing mental exercises to bring you to a higher state of consciousness.
                </p><br>
               <b>Some of the benefits of yoga meditation:</b><br>

                <p>1. Yoga meditation is associated with increased mindfulness and an improved mood. In one study, people who practiced
                yoga and yoga meditation had better mental health, more profound spiritual well-being, and fewer depressive symptoms
                than people who didn’t do these practices.
            </p><br><br>
            <p>
                     2. The breathing in yoga meditations helps to change your brain waves from excited to relaxed. When you slow your brain
                    waves down, your mind can become clearer, and your brain health can improve.
                </p><br><br>
               
                <p>
               3. Yoga and meditation both reduce stress by promoting physical and mental relaxation. When you’re relaxed, you activate
                a part of the nervous system called the parasympathetic nervous system. This helps to lower your heart rate, blood
                pressure, and levels of stress hormones like cortisol. When you reduce stress, you decrease inflammation throughout your
                body, as well as anxiety. This leads to overall health, especially for your heart
                </p><br><br>

                <p>
                4.Yoga meditations may help you sleep better, which also helps decrease stress, stress-related anxiety, depressive
                symptoms, and inflammation
                </p><br><br>
                <p>
                5.Yoga and meditation improve your self-awareness and self-compassion, which can help relieve sad or heavy emotions.
