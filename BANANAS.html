                    Don’t eat bananas because they are full of carbohydrates and these are converted into fat inside
                        your body!
                        This is actually one of the myths. People think that banana makes them pile on pounds because they are
                full of carbohydrates, which they are, but that doesn’t mean you should exclude them.

                </p>

                <p> 
                    People doesn’t get there is a huge difference between the two kinds of carbohydrates and while one type
                is linked to weight issues, namely the bad carbs found in white rice,which bread etc., you should know
                that bananas contain fructose, which is one of the best carbohydrates you can eat.
                </p><br>

                <p>A study led by J.P.Thakorlal and her team of researchers, found that green bananas might actually
                    increase fat burning. The resistant starch in green banana simply prevents the body from using the
                    carbohydrates as energy. Thakorlal and his team say that the human body is therefore compelled to burn
                    the stored fat as energy, thus contributing to accelerated weight loss.<br>
                    Sounds promising right, but these are green bananas, and they are not easy to eat because you need to
                    cook them first, which is something many busy folks don’t have time to do. And anyway, most of us just
                    want to eat our tasty fruit immediately.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Martica Heaner, pH.d,M.A,M.Ed states in an article published on the reputable website, MSN Healthy
                Living, that a ‘ripe banana’ contains 100 calories. That’s fewer calories that most of the commercial
                sport drinks sold on the high street, and makes it an ideal, and totally natural, sport snack.
                </p><br>
            
                <p>
                    She points out that a ripe banana contains a lot of fructose, the fruit’s natural sugar when compared it
                to other fruits . However, she emphasize that fructose is not in anyway fattening. So you now know that
                yellow bananas are good for us.
                </p><br>Although I don’t recommend you to grab a banana if you happen to wake up during the night(especially
                if you are not hungry), just bear in mind that if you ever do stir feeling famished, know that you
                can happily eat a banana without worrying about the weight myth associated with this fruit.
